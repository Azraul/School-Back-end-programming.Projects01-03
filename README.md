# School-Back-end-programming.Projects01-03
###### PROJECTS 01 - 03
All projects in the course Back-end Programming, which was the third course we took @Arcada in web design that focused on PHP.
Perhaps an unpopular opinion but PHP was a delight to work with and I really felt like I took a bigger leap forward in this course compared to earlier courses @Arcada.
Project 01 is mostly an experiment whereas Project 02 is the beginning to a forum that is finalized in Project 03.
I recommend focusing any attention on Project 03 as the code was restructured and has the most complete functionality.

## Installation
The project was built with mySQL and run with XAMPP, I'd recommend importing the database structure before launching the project.
